# MISCELLANEOUS IDEAS

## All mobs
* Humanoid mobs can use chests

## Village mobs (Villagers, Illagers, Iron golems)
* Villagers having inventory
* Villagers crafting
* Villagers pick up items according to profession
* Villagers trading between themselves
* Villagers actually doing work (farming, mining) in the range of the village
* Villager relationships
* Bigger wander away distance
* Illagers(?) wielding a pickaxe can dig a tunnel to run away from iron golem
* Iron golems can sometimes destroy natural blocks (but not too destructive)
* Villagers dealing with animals can own them, put them on a leash
* Male and female villagers with different base texture (hair please!)
* Clothing, including work clothing overlays

## Farm mobs (Sheep, chicken and cows)
* Farm mobs have hunger; seek nearest grass during day and consume it to stay alive
* Nearby farm mobs flee when another farm mob is attacked
* Farm mobs spawn only in villages

## Evil mobs (Zombies, skeletons, witches, creepers, ...)
* Evil mobs attack NPCs by default
* Mobs that burn in sunlight make it a priority to seek a water node or a node protected from direct sunlight
* Skeletons need to make their arrows; they start with a full stack
* Skeletons' bows have wear and eventually get destroyed; they have to make a new one once that happens.
* Witches start with a set of potions in their inventory, can make new potions when they have ingredients

## Items
* Clothing items (like armor, worn under it, also provide some protection)
* Walking bare-footed can deal a little damage
* Walking naked while raining or snowing can likewise deal damage

## Structures
* Witch huts have a chest with ingredients that the witch can use
